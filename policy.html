                    </p>

                    <h4>How Long We Store Personal Data</h4>
                    <p>
                        User data will be stored until the purpose the data was collected for has been achieved.<br><br>

                        You will be notified if your data is kept for longer than this period.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>How We Protect Your Personal Data</h4>
                    <p>
                        e.g. In order to protect your security, we use the strongest available browser encryption and store all of our data on servers in secure facilities. All data is only accessible to our employees. Our employees are bound by strict confidentiality agreements and a breach of this agreement would result in the employee's termination.<br><br>

                        While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of harm. The Internet as a whole can be insecure at times and therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.<br><br>
                    </p>

If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 years of age, the personal data will be deleted as soon as possible. If a child under 13 years of age has provided us with personal data their parent or guardian may contact our privacy officer.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>How to Access, Modify, Delete, or Challenge the Data Collected</h4>
